# MRSI Analysis Pipeline (MNI)

Official Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) pipeline guide from the **Brain Tumor Research Group** at the **Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)**.

## Mission
We aim to **democratize access to multi-voxel MRSI** and support **more standardized clinical integration**.

## What this repository contains
- Documentation and usage instructions for the MRSI analysis pipeline
- Recommended workflows for processing and fitting

Our work is based on open-source tools: (1) HD-BET for robust brain extraction, (2) ANTs for MRI pre-processing, (3) FSL-MRS for MRS pre-processing and fitting, and (4) FID-A for the basis set generation
